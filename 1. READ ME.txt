This is a project for Oracle 3 created by Edward Garcia
This can be used as a reference for any incoming or current projects by any students who are in need of help with regards
to the data management course or any database courses provided within the academic institution.

May this serve as a guide for your project and for the betterment of our republic, may it be low tide or even high tide, 
we shall make it better by means of our data management.(LOL)


HOW TO MAKE IT WORK:
1. PUT THE WHOLE FILE INTO YOUR DESKTOP LOCATION.
2. OPEN EACH FMB FILES AND CHANGE EACH LOCATION INTO THE DESIGNATED LOCATION OF THAT FILE.

NOTE:
The only files that you need are the following:
1. INSERTION 
This contains all the insertion forms for the whole clinic

2. VIEW UPDATE DELETE
This contains all the viewing, deleting, and even updating of all the data for the whole clinic.

3. PROJECT CODES/TABLE ONLY
Contains all the declarations for each entity
